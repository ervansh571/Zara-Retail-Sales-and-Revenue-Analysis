# Zara-Retail-Sales-and-Revenue-Analysis
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze ZARA retail sales performance with a strong focus on revenue trends and business insights. The dashboard is designed to help understand sales behavior, identify revenue-driving factors, and support data-driven decision-making in the retail domain.
The dashboard consists of two main analytical pages:

1. ZARA Retail Sales Analysis

This page provides an overview of overall retail performance. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total revenue, product-wise performance, and category-level insights. Visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and slicers are used to analyze trends across different dimensions. The goal of this page is to give a clear understanding of how ZARA products are performing in the retail market and to highlight patterns in customer demand.

2. Revenue Analysis

The revenue analysis page focuses specifically on financial performance. It helps identify high-revenue products, revenue growth trends, and variations over time. This page enables stakeholders to quickly recognize which products or segments contribute the most to revenue and where improvements or strategic changes may be required.
